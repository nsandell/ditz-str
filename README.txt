== DESCRIPTION

Ditz is a simple, light-weight distributed issue tracker designed to work with
distributed version control systems like git, darcs, Mercurial, and Bazaar. It
can also be used with centralized systems like SVN.

Ditz maintains an issue database directory on disk, with files written in a
line-based and human-editable format. This directory can be kept under version
control, alongside project code.

Ditz provides a simple, console-based interface for creating and updating the
issue database files, and some basic static HTML generation capabilities for
producing world-readable status pages (for a demo, see the ditz ditz page).

Ditz includes a robust plugin system for adding commands, model fields, and
modifying output. See PLUGINS.txt for documentation on the pre-shipped plugins.

Ditz currently offers no central public method of bug submission. 

== USING DITZ

There are several different ways to use Ditz:

1. Treat issue change the same as code change: include it as part of commits,
   and merge it with changes from other developers, resolving conflicts in the
   usual manner.
2. Keep the issue database in the repository but in a separate branch. Issue
   changes can be managed by your VCS, but is not tied directly to code
   commits.
3. Keep the issue database separate and not under VCS at all.

All of these options are supported; the choice of which to use depends on your
workflow.

Option #1 is probably most appropriate for the unsynchronized, distributed
development, since it allows individual developers to modify issue state with a
minimum of hassle. Option #2 is most suitable for synchronized development, as
issue state change can be transmitted independently of code change (see also
the git-sync plugin) and can act as a sychronization mechanism. Option #3 is
only useful with some other distribution mechanism, like a central web
interface.

== THE DITZ DATA MODEL

By default, Ditz includes the bare minimum set of features necessary for
open-source development. Features like time spent, priority, assignment of
tasks to developers, due dates, etc. are purposely relegated to the plugin
system.

A Ditz project consists of issues, releases and components.

Issues:
  Issues are the fundamental currency of issue tracking. A Ditz issue is either
  a feature or a bug, but this distinction currently doesn't affect anything
  other than how they're displayed.

  Each issue belongs to exactly one component, and is part of zero or one
  releases.

  Each issues has an exportable id, in the form of 40 random hex characters.
  This id is "guaranteed" to be unique across all possible issues and
  developers, present and future. Issue ids are typically not exposed to the
  user.

  Issues also have a non-global, non-exportable name, which is short and
  human-readable. All Ditz commands use issue names in addition to issue ids.
  Issue names (but not issue ids) may change in certain circumstances, e.g.
  after a "ditz drop" command.

  Issue names can be specified in comments, titles and descriptions, and Ditz
  will automatically rewrite them as necessary when they change.

Components:
  There is always one "general" component, named after the project itself. In
  the simplest case, this is the only component, and the user is never bothered
  with the question of which component to assign an issue to.

  Components simply provide a way of organizing issues, and have no real
  functionality. Issues names are derived from the component they're assigned
  to.

Releases:
  A release is the primary grouping mechanism for issues. Status commands like
  "ditz status" and "ditz todo" always group issues by release. When a release
  is 100% complete, it can be marked as released, and its issues will cease
  appearing in Ditz status and todo messages.
